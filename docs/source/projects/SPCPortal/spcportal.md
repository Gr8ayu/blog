# SPCPortal

## Introduction


Student Placement Coordinator Portal is a open source web application developed to help college in placement drive. It track student's application, create profile, validate eligibility criteria for the student.

In nearly all educational institutes placement record holds a major criteria for analysing quality of education and performance of an Institute. These institutes also act as a bridge between industries and students and bring these two stakeholders together. Having a robust platform for proper interaction between them will make recruitment streamlined. Better recruitment improves utilization of human resources and contributes to the nation’s economy.

## Project Details

Proposed portal is meant as a replacement for an already existing portal. The career portal that currently exists deals with problems like lack of adequate functionalities, improper management, major bugs in the design as well as improperly working features. Though present, the above problems have made it difficult for the students to use it as their goto platform for placement activities. Also, the current platform is only for placement purposes and isn’t applicable for internships.

Keeping in mind the above problems, the new portal is being built to provide much more versatility and flexibility in terms of features and better efficiency and performance. It is an open source project with an active developer team to support it. It is developed to run on Web Browsers as of now, but can be turned into a Progressive Web App (PWA) as well.
